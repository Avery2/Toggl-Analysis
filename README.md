# Toggl-Analysis

I tracked all my worked hours for over a year. This (will be) an analysis of that.

## Places to do more

I want to try to run a classification algorithm on the times to see if it's able to pick up any patterns in schedules.

I eventually want to cross reference with other sources of information. I used google calendar daily. I also have an app Qbserve that automatically tracks and categorizes computer usage.

For personal reference, I also have journal entries of varying detail to reference to see what effects my productivity or to see what interesting patterns there are.
